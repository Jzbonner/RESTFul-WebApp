# React-Backend Environment
This is a playground environment that demonstrates the basics of setting up a MongoDB server and using Express.js, Ajax and React.js (instead of a templating service like Jade/Pug) to asynchronously update a web page using JSON data. This web application is a wire-frame/demo for more complicated web applications with extended functionality.
